# The idea
   For the idea, I choose a topic I really interested in, who is the GOAT player in tennis history. I try to develop the idea with good data to support and clear dataviz . Fially, I found a good database that I summarize in the following link and develop my outline and my selection logic within the part one of the project. 
#### My idea was recorded in 
   [The project outline](https://github.com/YuxiWangjack/final-project-part-1/blob/master/part1.md)
    
# Design and user research
  For the design and user research, I developed my first draft of wireframe from the part one outline and I did some questionnaires for my classmate to ask feedback. From their feedback, I found that all of interviewees are understanding the research is about, and some of them feel the research is quite interesting, especially the students who are interested in tennis. And most of them understand my logic to select the best player in history. However,some of them feel confused why I do not just use one standard to select the top player. After I explained to her, she got point and reckon the approach is fine. But some audiences did not interested in tennis at all, and that cause me to make some change in the final version of the wireframe.

# Final data story
#### Intended Audience

My original list of the intended audiences including normal students and some student who interested in tennis. However, as I told the story of normal student, especially to my classmate, I found a lot of them did not understand the tennis rule. Thus I include a introduction of tennis in the first few pages of my final deliverable. 

In an effort to appeal to my classmates and the layperson, I included many tennis play photo and gif graph so that the audience can engage in the research, rather than feeling it boring. For the audience interested in tennis, I also included the dataviz of championship history of all the palyers. I think these will be working well in enagaging those who are or try to interested interested in tennis. I used various media tools such as images and documentary to keep the audience engaged.

#### Learned point

My desion of design is mainly from audience feedback, the first takeaway from this project is that as you design a prodect or research or anything, you should ask some feedback from your potential audience. Sometimes as the author, we have lose the point of view of a normal audience, actually we did not understand the audience unless we ask the audience feedback. Based on the feedback to improve your design will be the most important part. 

Prepare the presentation will be second takeaway of mine. Though the presentation is not need to prepare for long time, the process of prepare is a good way to check your whole porject. For me, I have change the stupid, small mistake from the process and also make the logic of the project more fluent. 

Find a project that you really interested in will be helpful for the whole process of design your project. Although the project cost a lot of time. I feel really enjoyable to do all the things. And the process of design is also a way for me to learn the tennis history and make me feel more confident as I talk about tennis. Basiclly, a interested topic will make you get more from the design and it is also a project that I really want to share with others.
