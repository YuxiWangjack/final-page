# The idea
   For the idea, I choose a topic I really interested in, who is the GOAT player in tennis history,I try to develop the idea with good dataviz. Fially I found a good database that I summarize in the following link and develop my outline and my selection logic within the part one of the project. 
#### My idea was recorded in 
   The project outline[https://github.com/YuxiWangjack/final-project-part-1/blob/master/part1.md]
    
# Design and user research
  For the design and user research, I develop my first draft of wireframe from the part one outline and I did some „ÄÅquestionnaire for my classmate, from their feedback I found that all of interviewees are understanding the research is about, and some of them feel the research is quite interesting, especially the students who are interested in tennis. And most of them understand my logic to select the best player in history. Some of them feel confused why I do not just use one standard to select the top player. After I explained to her, she got point and reckon the approach is fine. But some audience did not interested in tennis at all, and that cause me to make some change in the final version of the wireframe. 
#### Sketches, research protocol, findings and Wireframes are found in 
   The part 2 of final project [https://github.com/YuxiWangjack/Final-Project-part-II]
   
# Final data story
#### Intended Audience

My original list of the intended audiences including normal students and some student who interested in tennis. However, as I told the story of normal student, especially to my classmate, I found a lot of them did not understand the tennis rule. Thus I include a introduction of tennis in the first few pages of my final deliverable. 

In an effort to appeal to my classmates and the layperson, I included many tennis play photo and gif graph so that the audience can engage in the research, rather than feeling it boring. For the audience interested in tennis, I also included the dataviz of championship history of all the palyers. I think these will be working well in enagaging those who are or try to interested interested in tennis. I used various media tools such as images and documentary to keep the audience engaged.
